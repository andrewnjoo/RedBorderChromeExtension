- show on/off text in icon
- add shortcut for Ctrl + B (windows) or ⌘ + B (mac) to toggle red border on/off

TODO:
1. add option to turn off ⌘+B keyboard shortcut as it interferes with other websites that have this hotkey e.g. Notion bold text shortcut is also ⌘+B
2. add different colors (green, blue, red)
3. add some better styling to the popup.
